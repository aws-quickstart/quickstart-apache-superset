== Best practices for using {partner-product-short-name} on AWS
If you choose *Yes* for the *WithExample* option, you can explore a sample dashboard with a predefined dataset after you log in to the Superset console. Otherwise, you must connect to your datasource (for example, Amazon Redshift or Amazon S3), customize your data, and create a dashboard from the provided visualization plugins. For more information, see the https://superset.apache.org/docs[Superset documentation^].

== Security
Apache Superset provides a granular security model through users, roles, and customized permissions. You can associate multiple roles that comprise sets of permissions to access different Superset resources, including *Model & Action*, *Views*, *Data Sources*, and *Databases*. By creating filters assigned to a particular table, the granularity of data access is row level, which means you can specify rows that meet only certain conditions for your users. For more information, see https://superset.apache.org/docs/security[Superset Security^].
