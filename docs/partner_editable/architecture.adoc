image::../images/architecture_diagram.png[Architecture]

As shown in <<architecture1>>, the Quick Start sets up the following:

* A highly available architecture that spans two Availability Zones.*
* A VPC configured with public and private subnets, according to AWS
best practices, to provide you with your own virtual network on AWS.*
* A managed internet gateway to direct inbound traffic to a Network Load Balancer, which manages traffic to the AWS Fargate cluster.
* In the public subnets, managed network address translation (NAT) gateways to provide outbound internet access for resources in the private subnets.*
* In the private subnets:
** An Amazon ECS cluster using AWS Fargate to provide all Superset functions, including the core system, cache, database, message queue, and frontend.
** Amazon EFS to provide metadata, query cached-data persistency, and share service modules.
** AWS Cloud Map, a discovery service for application resources.
* Amazon Athena, a serverless, interactive service to query data and analyze big data in Amazon S3 using standard SQL.
* Amazon Redshift, a fully managed, data-warehouse service.
* Supported database systems, such as Amazon Athena, Amazon Redshift, ClickHouse, MySQL, and PostgreSQL.

[.small]#* The template that deploys the Quick Start into an existing VPC skips the components marked by asterisks and prompts you for your existing VPC configuration.#
