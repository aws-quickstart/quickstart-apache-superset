image::../images/architecture_diagram.png[Architecture]

As shown in <<architecture1>>, the Quick Start sets up the following:

* A highly available architecture that spans two Availability Zones.*
* A VPC configured with public and private subnets, according to AWS
best practices, to provide you with your own virtual network on AWS.*
* In the public subnets:
** Managed internet gateway for inbound traffic to an Application Load Balancer (ALB).
** Managed network address translation (NAT) gateways to provide outbound
internet access for resources in the private subnets.*
* An Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) cluster to provide all Superset functions, including the core system, cache, database, message queue, and frontend.
* An Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) to provide metadata, query cache data persistency, and share service modules.

[.small]#* The template that deploys the Quick Start into an existing VPC skips the components marked by asterisks and prompts you for your existing VPC configuration.#
